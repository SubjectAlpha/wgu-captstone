# WGU Capstone Application Summary

## Business Case

The Company is a small start-up organization looking for an application to manage their customer contact information. I believe that OpenCMS will fulfill all of their requirements for managing customer information.

## Software Development Lifecycle

The software development lifecycle system used for this project was the Agile method. I planned out the work beforehand and worked in two weeks sprints to complete the work that I had ticketed. Work will continue as I allow clients to submit feature requests and bug reports.

## Deliverables

The deliverables for this application are an instance of OpenCMS, and an instance of MariaDB or MySQL to be installed on their system. To accomplish this goal and allow for ease of scalability the application has been Docker-ized. This means the application is easy to get up and running, as well as scale in size under load.

## Implementation Plan

## Timeline

The timeline to build this application is approximately two months.
